#  AI166 - Mobile projects with SAP Joule for Consultants and SAP Joule for Developers

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2025 session AI166 - Mobile projects with SAP Joule for Consultants and SAP Joule for Developers

## Overview

In this session, learn how Joule for Consultants (J4C) and Joule for Developers (J4D) can help developers accelerate mobile app development and assist admins in seamlessly taking advantage of the many features provided by SAP Build's mobile technology stack.

## Requirements

To test the app you’ve built, you’ll need to **use your own mobile phone**. Please ensure your device is fully charged and connected to the event Wi-Fi.

## Use Case
ACME Logistics has engaged you to build and run a mobile app for their warehouse staff. The app must work on iOS and Android, support barcode scanning, and keep pace with massive parcel volumes by using a local store for instant updates that syncs seamlessly with the back end. 

Your mandate goes beyond delivery. You’re also responsible for day-to-day operations and continuously adapting the app as the needs evolve.
